# üè° üß™ Home Lab

Project status: _BETA_ (but pretty stable).

## üìñ Overview

This mono repository houses the infrastructure for my homelab. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This project aims to achieve its goals while adhering to industry-standard practices and fostering continuous learning.
