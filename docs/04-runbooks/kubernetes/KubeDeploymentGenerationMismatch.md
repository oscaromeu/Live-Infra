# KubeDeploymentGenerationMismatch

## Meaning

Deployment generation mismatch due to possible roll-back.

## Impact

Service degradation or unavailability.

## Diagnosis

See [Kubernetes Docs - Failed Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#failed-deployment)

- Check out rollout history `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE rollout history deployment $NAME`
- Check rollout status if it is not paused
- Check deployment status via `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE describe deployment $NAME`.
- Check how many replicas are there declared.
- Investigate if new pods are not crashing.
- Check the status of the pods which belong to the replica sets under the deployment.
- Check pod template parameters such as:
  - pod priority - maybe it was evicted by other more important pods
  - resources - maybe it tries to use unavailable resource, such as GPU
    but there is limited number of nodes with GPU
  - affinity rules - maybe due to affinities and not enough nodes it is
    not possible to schedule pods
  - pod termination grace period - if too long then pods may be for too long
    in terminating state
- Check if Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is not triggered due to untested
  values (requests values).
- Check if cluster-autoscaler is able to create new nodes - see its logs or
  cluster-autoscaler status configmap.

## Mitigation

Depending on the conditions usually adding new nodes solves the issue.

Otherwise probably deployment or HPA definition needs to be fixed.
If you can not add nodes then you can change rolling update strategy to `Recreate`.
Sometimes manually deleting pod helps :)

In rare cases roll back to previous version - see [Kubernetes Docs - Rolling Back](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision)

In extremely rare situations scale oldest ReplicaSets to 0 and delete them.
