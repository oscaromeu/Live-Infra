# KubeClientErrors

## Meaning

Kubernetes API server client is experiencing over 1% error rate in the last 15 minutes.

## Impact

Specific kubernetes client may malfunction. Service degradation.

## Diagnosis

Usual issues:

- networking errors
- too low resources to perform given API calls (usually too low CPU/memory requests)
- wrong api client (old libraries)
- investigate if the app does not request more data than it really requires
  from kubernetes API, for example it has too wide permissions and scans for
  resources in all namespaces.

Check logs from client side (sometimes app logs).


## Mitigation

TODO
