# KubeStatefulSetUpdateNotRolledOut

## Meaning

StatefulSet update has not been rolled out.

## Impact

Service degradation or unavailability.

## Diagnosis

- Check statefulset via `kubectl -n $NAMESPACE describe statefulset $NAME`.
- Check if statefuls update was not paused manually (see status)
- Check how many replicas are there declared.
- Check the status of the pods which belong to the replica sets under the
  statefulset.
- Check pod template parameters such as:
  - pod priority - maybe it was evicted by other more importand pods
  - resources - maybe it tries to use unavailabe resource, such as GPU but
    there is limited number of nodes with GPU
  - affinity rules - maybe due to affinities and not enough nodes it is
    not possible to schedule pods
  - pod termination grace period - if too long then pods may be for too long
    in terminating state
- Check if there are issues with attaching disks to statefulset - for example
  disk was in Zone A, but pod is scheduled in Zone B.
- Check if Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is not triggered due to untested
  values (requests values).
- Check if cluster-autoscaler is able to create new nodes - see its logs or
  cluster-autoscaler status configmap.

## Mitigation
