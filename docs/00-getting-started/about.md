# About

This documentation uses the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr) technical documentation system, so is split between four modes of documentation:

+ Getting started
+ How to Guides
+ Knowledge Base
+ Reference

The website is generated using Material for MkDocs and can be viewed at homelab.oscaromeu.io

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me on the community's Discord server.
