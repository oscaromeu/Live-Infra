## Kustomize or Helm?

Both Kustomize and Helm are popular tools for managing Kubernetes resources. They both help you manage and deploy your applications to Kubernetes clusters, but they have different features and use cases.

Kustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes resource files. It allows you to manage and maintain different variations of a single resource file, called "bases", and apply different patches to them. Kustomize can also generate a new resource file with the changes you've made. This way you can maintain the same base resource file for different environments and apply specific changes to each of them. This approach allows for a better separation of concerns between the different environments and a more maintainable codebase.

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It allows you to manage and deploy your applications as a package, called "charts". Charts are a collection of Kubernetes resource files and a set of templates for generating those files. Helm also provides a command-line interface for managing and installing charts, and it includes a feature called "releases" which allows you to manage the lifecycle of your applications.

In summary, Kustomize is mainly used to customize and manage Kubernetes resource files, while Helm is mainly used to package, distribute and manage the lifecycle of your applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

Both tools are widely used and it depends on the specific needs of your organization and the way you want to manage your applications. Kustomize can be a great fit for teams that want to maintain a single resource file for multiple environments and apply specific changes to each of them, while Helm can be a great fit for teams that want to package, distribute and manage the lifecycle of their applications in a centralized way.
