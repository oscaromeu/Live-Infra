## Helm rollback failed

### Meaning

There is an existing issue with the Flux helm-controller (https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller/issues/149) that can cause HelmReleases to get "stuck" with an error message like "Helm upgrade failed: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress". This can happen anytime the helm-controller is restarted while a HelmRelease is upgrading/installing/etc.


### Mitigation

To ensure the HelmRelease error was caused by the helm-controller restarting, first try to suspend/resume the HelmRelease:

```
flux suspend hr <helmrelease> -n <namespace>
flux resume hr <helmrelease> -n <namespace>
```

You can find any flux resource that is not ready by running

```
flux get all -A --status-selector ready=false
```

#### Scenario A

After applying suspend/resume the issue is solved and a message with "Release reconciliation succeeded" appears.

**Example**

```
âžœ  ~ flux get all -A --status-selector ready=false

NAMESPACE       NAME    REVISION        SUSPENDED       READY   MESSAGE

                                                                                Last Helm logs:

                                                                                preparing rollback of gatus
                                                                                rolling back gatus (current: v2, target: v1)
                                                                                creating rolled back release for gatus
                                                                                performing rollback of gatus
```

#### Scenario B

or it will fail with the same error as before, i.e: "Helm upgrade failed: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress".

If the HelmRelease is still in the failed state, it's likely related to the helm-controller restarting. To resolve the issue, do the following.

1. List secrets containing the affected HelmRelease name.

**Example**

```
sh.helm.release.v1.blackbox-exporter.v1         helm.sh/release.v1                    1      13d
sh.helm.release.v1.gatus.v1                     helm.sh/release.v1                    1      13d
sh.helm.release.v1.gatus.v2                     helm.sh/release.v1                    1      6d13h
sh.helm.release.v1.gatus.v3                     helm.sh/release.v1                    1      6d13h
sh.helm.release.v1.gatus.v4                     helm.sh/release.v1                    1      6m46s
sh.helm.release.v1.gatus.v5                     helm.sh/release.v1                    1      5m30s
```

2. Find and delete the most recent revision secret (i.e. `sh.helm.release.v1.*.<revision>`)

**Example**

```
kubectl get secrets -n monitoring | grep gatus | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs -I{} sh -c "kubectl delete secret -n monitoring {}
```

3. suspend/resume the HelmRelease to trigger a reconciliation

**Example**

```
flux resume hr gatus -n monitoring
```

4. You should see the HelmRelease get reconciled then eventually the upgrade/install will succeed.

### Manually rollback to a previous revision

1. List all the releases
2. Check the history for that release
3. Rollback the release to a previous revision

```
helm list -Aa
helm history <release> -n <name-space>
helm rollback <release> <revision> -n <name-space>
```
